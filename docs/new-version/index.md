#### SVG Editor

The SVG editor is used for editing and managing SVG pictures in the library. Users can adjust styles and modify properties within the system without the need for external software, thereby increasing the reuse rate and efficiency of graphic resources.

- It supports adjustments to colors, sizes, line widths, and fill patterns.
- Text content in SVG can be modified.
- The display/hide status of elements can be set.
- It supports binding tags to SVG elements to achieve dynamic effects.
- After editing, it can be directly saved to the library for reuse by other pages or controls. 

#### Toggle Button

Toggle Button is a type of button control that enables switching between two states (on/off). 

When clicked, the button will switch between these two states and can clearly indicate the current state. It is commonly used to control boolean devices, such as start/stop or on/off functions.

####  2-State Button

The 2-State Button is a type of button control with two distinct states. The common states are ON/OFF, Start/Stop, or Enable/Disable.

Compared with the Toggle Button, it usually configures separate appearance styles (colors, text, etc.) for each state, allowing users to more intuitively identify the current state.

In addition to being used for state display, it can also perform value control by binding properties, etc., when the button is clicked. 

#### Multi-State Button

The Multi-State Button has multiple states and can switch between them. Specific appearance styles, colors, text, etc. can be set for each state.

Each state can correspond to different operations or functions. Besides being used for state display, it can also control values by binding properties when the button is clicked.

#### The historical data of tags supports storing the raw values

When storing the historical data of tags, the original historical values of the tags can be stored, that is, the data that has not been compressed or processed, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the historical records.

#### Page functions and expression functions

By writing page functions or expression functions, they can be called in multiple controls on the page to achieve logical reuse and centralized management at the page level, avoiding repetitive writing in each control. By writing once and using globally, the workload of repetition is reduced and the maintenance efficiency is improved.

#### The enable and disable of animations support binding

The enable and disable states of animations support binding through properties. Users can dynamically control the opening and closing of animations according to running conditions or device states, thereby achieving more flexible interaction effects.
